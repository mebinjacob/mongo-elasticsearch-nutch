[Apache Nutch](http://nutch.apache.org/) is a highly extensible and scalable open source web crawler software project. A well matured, production ready crawler.

## Before You Begin
Before you begin we recommend you read about the basic building blocks that assemble an Apache Nutch crawler:
* Apache Nutch - Go through [Nutch Official Website](http://nutch.apache.org/) and proceed to their [Nutch 2.x tutorial](http://wiki.apache.org/nutch/Nutch2Tutorial), which should help you understand how crawling with apache nutch works.

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have installed all of the following prerequisites on your development machine:
* MongoDB - [Download & Install MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/downloads), and make sure it's running on the default port (27017).
* Elasticsearch - You're going to use the [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/) analytics engine to manage the index of your crawls.


## Deployment With Docker
* Install [Docker](http://www.docker.com/)
* Install [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install)

## Build Docker Image
```
docker build -t tpickett/nutch .
```
### Create Volume for data storage
```
docker volume create mongo
```

## Use with existing mongodb and elasticsearch servers
```
docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 8081:8081 -e MONGO_HOST="localhost" -e MONGO_PORT="27017" -e ELASTICSEARCH_HOST="localhost" -e ELASTICSEARCH_PORT="9300" --name nutch tpickett/nutch
```

## Docker Compose support
included with the docker image is a 'docker-compose.yaml' file. this file will bring up a Mongodb server an Elasticsearch server and the Apache Nutch crawler. Everything you need in one command!
```
docker-compose up
```

## Getting Started With Apache Nutch
You have your nutch crawler started, but there is a lot of stuff to understand. We recommend you go over the [Nutch tutorials](http://wiki.apache.org/nutch/#Tutorials).
In the tutorials they will go over the process of crawling/indexing etc... After familiarizing yourself with Apache Nutch enter the container to start using Nutch!
```
docker exec -it mongoelasticsearchnutch_nutch_1 /bin/bash
mkdir $NUTCH_HOME/runtime/local/urls
touch $NUTCH_HOME/runtime/local/urls/seed.txt
echo "http://reddit.com" >> $NUTCH_HOME/runtime/local/urls/seed.txt
$NUTCH_HOME/runtime/local/bin/nutch inject $NUTCH_HOME/runtime/local/urls/seed.txt
$NUTCH_HOME/runtime/local/bin/nutch generate -topN 10
$NUTCH_HOME/runtime/local/bin/nutch fetch -all
$NUTCH_HOME/runtime/local/bin/nutch parse -all
$NUTCH_HOME/runtime/local/bin/nutch updatedb -all
$NUTCH_HOME/runtime/local/bin/nutch index -all
```
